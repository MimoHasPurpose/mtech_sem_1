## list of experiments:

1. Perform comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the uncleaned Iris dataset to understand data distribution, detect missing values or outliers, and prepare the dataset for modelling.
2. Implement the KNN classification algorithm to predict breast cancer diagnosis and evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate classification metrics.
3. Develop and implement Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Best-First Search algorithms. Each algorithm should accept user inputs, generate the state-space search tree, identify the optimal path, and compare the algorithms based on performance.
4. To implement the A* (A-Star) algorithm for finding the optimal path between a start and goal node in a graph using heuristic search.
5. Apply the Linear Regression model on the Boston Housing dataset to predict housing prices and evaluate the model performance using relevant regression metrics.
6. Implement the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict heart disease occurrence and assess its effectiveness using suitable evaluation metrics.
7. Implement the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm on the weather forecasting dataset and analyze its predictive performance using classification metrics.
8. Implement the ID3 decision tree algorithm on the weather forecasting dataset and evaluate its accuracy and performance using standard evaluation metrics.
9. To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm for grouping unlabeled data into clusters based on feature similarity and evaluate its performance using visualisation and internal metrics.
10. Apply the Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify credit card data and evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate classification metrics.
11. Implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for classification: (I) From scratch using NumPy (II) Using Scikit-learn library
     and to perform hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search and Cross-validation.
